### Fonts

In designing this quiz, I wanted to create a fun and inviting experience for my users, and I believe that the choice of fonts plays a significant role in achieving this goal.

For the headings and buttons, I used Teko, a bold and modern sans-serif typeface with a unique geometric design. Its thick, rounded strokes and tight spacing make it stand out and grab the user's attention, giving a sense of playfulness and excitement to the overall design.

For the questions and subheadings, I opted for Monda, another sans-serif font with a rounded and friendly appearance. It is both legible and fun, and its subtle curves give it a playful touch, making it an excellent fit for my quiz.

Finally, for the general text and instructions, I chose Roboto, a widely-used sans-serif typeface known for its versatility and readability. Its clean lines and clear spacing ensure that the user can easily navigate the quiz and focus on the questions at hand.

I believe that this combination of fonts creates a cohesive and enjoyable design that will make my quiz more engaging and memorable for my users.
